	The bugzilla data is in Metric's ElasticSearch container, and is updated every 10 minutes.  My goal is to provide metrics and numbers to development teams tha can not be easily pulled from Bugzilla directly.

		<p>This past week-and-a-half I have been familiarizing myself with
			Metric's Telemetry setup, learning Python for ReleaseManagement's
			new dashboards, and trying to push something out for the Metro project.</p>
		<p>The biggest barrier to Metro is the limitation of my charting library,
			<a href="http://www.webdetails.pt/ctools.html#tabccc">CCC (Community Chart Components)</a>.  They have released version 2, and I was still stuck on version 1.
		The new version has about 100 javascript files, and would be a pain to include all my pages (did I mention I have no server,
			and all my pages are static?).  I would consider using the minimized version in a single file, but these libraries are still new, and require some
			debugging to work properly on the edge cases I will inevitably encounter.  
		</p>
			<p>The solution is to use something like require.js to manage the packaging of this
			large library, and the many other module dependencies.</p>

		<p>I have been working on visualizing the agile process being used by the
		<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Metro">Firefox Metro Development Project</a>.
		I am assuming that stories are direct children of iterations; so I can
		pull the stories, and their point values, with a simple query</p>

		<p>The technical complication is pulling bug counts:  The DAG formed by bug dependencies is ever-changing,
		and to get accurate historical counts I need the structure from any point in time.
		I have tried pulling the current DAG and assuming it does not change
		much, but that gives terrible results.</p>

		<p>In general, being able to follow the DAG over time will allow developers and
		managers see the full scope of a project; and be able to zoom in on past state to
		identify patterns.  Furthermore, in theory, developers need only add a new bug to
		the DAG at any depth, and it's effort (along with all dependencies) will be automatically
		reported to the projects affected.</p>

		<p>I hope with some powerful dependency reporting, Mozilla will get more use out of
		the bug dependency field in Bugzilla.</p>

		It is important the dashboards I make are relevant to the people who view them.
		This means they must be personalized to a certain degree.  Take, for example, defining the "age" of a bug:
		Is it time since created?, since triaged?, since flagged? since confirmed? since assigned?
		Each is relevant in a different way to each team.  I am still a long way off
		from providing this fine detail to any team, but I am making good first steps to
		defining "age" for security bugs:  Age is defined from the time it is first
		identified as a security bug, to the time it is closes. This definition may still not be
