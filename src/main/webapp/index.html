	The bugzilla data is in Metric's ElasticSearch container, and is updated every 10 minutes.  My goal is to provide metrics and numbers to development teams tha can not be easily pulled from Bugzilla directly.

		It is important the dashboards I make are relevant to the people who view them.
		This means they must be personalized to a certain degree.  Take, for example, defining the "age" of a bug:
		Is it time since created?, since triaged?, since flagged? since confirmed? since assigned?
		Each is relevant in a different way to each team.  I am still a long way off
		from providing this fine detail to any team, but I am making good first steps to
		defining "age" for security bugs:  Age is defined from the time it is first
		identified as a security bug, to the time it is closes. This definition may still not be
		accurate, but this is an iterative process.
